The two files (node.lib and node.pdb) comes from:
  http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.18/

The most convenient place for node.pdb is in the same directory as node.exe
binary. This way debugger will find file automatically.

Content of directory 'include' is files from source code of node.js from
directories:

  - deps/uv/include
  - deps/v8/include
  - src (only *.h files)
